- Implemented Genetic Algorithm operators (selection, crossover, mutation) with adjustable parameters.  
- Tested datasets from 3â€“63 cities, achieving near-optimal routes for Vietnam map.  
- Built interactive GUI for parameter tuning and route visualization.  
- Hybrid GA + Simulated Annealing improved convergence and solution quality.
